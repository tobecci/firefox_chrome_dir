# Firefox customizations

## description

contains customizations i have made to my firefox installation


## customizations

* hide tab bar (since i am using the [sidebery extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery/))
* change the firefox UI font
* change all page fonts (this crates a problem since some google websites use font icons)
* fixed the problem above by installing google design fonts locally and linking it in the `userContent.css` file
